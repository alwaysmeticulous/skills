# Worked example: kanban-demo, inline rename + keyboard card move

A complete run of the skill against a small app, including one target that
gained coverage and one that recorded fine and then failed to replay. Use it
to calibrate what "well-traced" looks like, and what a partial result looks
like when you report it honestly.

App: a Kanban board (`kanban-demo`), ~11 source files.

## Step 0-1 — Baseline

`meticulous auth get-project` came back as an unrelated project — the CLI's
selection drifts, so check it every time. After setting it correctly,
`test-run-for-commit` gave the baseline run id (keep it; Step 7 needs it).

Whole-repo baseline:

```
src/components/Card.tsx           78.3   <- lowest
src/components/Board.tsx          81.4   <- second lowest
src/components/Column.tsx         95.1
src/lib/utils.ts                  96.7
src/components/CommandPalette.tsx 97.4
src/components/CardModal.tsx      99.5
src/components/Toasts.tsx        100.0
...
```

## Step 2 — Picking targets

**There were no 0% files at all.** A skill that only hunts zeros would have
reported "nothing to do" on a codebase with two files a fifth uncovered. The
targets are simply the lowest percentages.

## Step 3 — Tracing

Percentages don't say _what_ is uncovered — get the executed ranges and read
the gaps:

```bash
meticulous agent js-coverage --globFilter "src/components/Card.tsx"
# executedRanges: 5-45;56-64;68-71;76-104;124-166
```

Gaps at 45-55, 65-67, 72-75, 105-123. Reading those lines showed they are not
scattered edge cases but two coherent features:

| Feature            | Uncovered code                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inline rename      | `Card.tsx` 45-54 (`commitTitle`), 64-67 (`onDoubleClick`), 105-123 (the rename `<input>`) |
| Keyboard card move | `Card.tsx` 72-75 (alt+arrow branch), `Board.tsx` 127-153 (`onKeyboardMove`)               |

Both lowest-coverage files shared the second feature — so one interaction was
expected to move both. That is the pattern to look for: group by feature, not
by file.

## Steps 4-6 — Driving

Two attempts, because the first one taught something.

**Attempt 1 (`agent-browser`).** Double-click the card title, type, Enter;
then focus a card and press Alt+ArrowRight. Everything worked live — title
changed, "renamed" toast, card moved. 13 events recorded.

Coverage afterwards was _worse_ than baseline. `get_session_data` showed why:
only **one** pointerdown/pointerup pair was recorded for the double-click. On
replay that is a single click, the rename input never opens, and the recorded
typing and Enter then target an element that does not exist — so the replay
diverges and covers less than the golden set did.

**Attempt 2 (Playwright).** Same flow, but the double-click sent two full
press/release pairs and `press('Alt+ArrowRight')` recorded a discrete Alt
keydown. 17 events.

## Step 7 — Comparing

```bash
meticulous agent js-coverage --headPlusTestRunIds "<newRunId>" \
  --includeAllFiles --includeCoveragePercentage
```

| File                       | Before | After    |
| -------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| `src/components/Board.tsx` | 81.4   | **92.1** |
| `src/components/Card.tsx`  | 78.3   | **80.7** |

Zero regressions elsewhere — which is the first thing to check. A result where
_every_ file has dropped is not a regression, it means the run you unioned
into was not the golden-set baseline.

## Step 8 — What actually moved, and what didn't

Compare executed ranges, not just percentages:

- `Board.tsx` gained 127-153 — `onKeyboardMove` ran. **The alt+arrow modifier
  survived replay**, because Playwright recorded the discrete Alt press.
- `Card.tsx` gained 72-75, the alt+arrow branch, and nothing else.
- `Card.tsx` 45-54 and 105-123 are **still uncovered**: the rename never
  replayed even with two real press/release pairs. The feature is only
  reachable via double-click, so there is no alternative path to drive.

Reported honestly: keyboard card move is now covered end to end; inline rename
records but does not replay, and is the open item. Don't let a headline
"+10.7% on Board.tsx" imply the whole flow landed.

Note also that the coverage gain only becomes the project's own number once a
session-selection cycle picks these sessions into the selected set.

## Step 9 — `.meticulousignore`

Nothing proposed. Every file in this repo executes in the browser, and the one
`n/a` file (`src/lib/types.ts`) is types-only and already outside the report.
An empty ignore-list PR is a legitimate outcome — better than inventing rules
to look productive.
